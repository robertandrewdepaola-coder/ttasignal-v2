Watchlist Interface Feedback for Claude:

Critical Issues
Missing Watchlist Name in Main Scanner Window

Current state: Shows only "39 tickers. Click to edit."

Problem: No indication of WHICH watchlist is currently active/being viewed

Need: Display the watchlist name prominently in the main scanner window (e.g., "AWKW Watchlist - 39 tickers")

No Collapse/Expand Functionality

Current limitation: Cannot collapse ticker lists to save screen space

Use case: Managing 10+ watchlists becomes unwieldy when all tickers are always expanded

Requested feature: Accordion-style collapse/expand controls so you can:

See all watchlist names at a glance

Expand only the watchlist(s) you want to work with

Keep others collapsed to reduce clutter

Unclear Side Panel Labels

The "AWKW" label in the side panel doesn't provide sufficient context

Should clearly indicate this is a watchlist name and which one is currently active

Suggested Improvements
Header Display: Add watchlist name as a header/title above the ticker list in the main scanner

Visual Hierarchy: Use collapse/expand arrows (▼/▶) next to each watchlist name

Active Indicator: Highlight or bold the currently selected watchlist

Persistent Labels: Keep watchlist names visible even when collapsed

The pull-down selector works fine for switching between watchlists—the issue is identifying which one you're currently viewing and managing multiple watchlists efficiently in the interface.
